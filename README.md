# Heart Disease
## Context
Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the number 1 cause of death globally, taking an estimated 17.9 million lives each year, which accounts for 31% of all deaths worldwide. Four out of 5CVD deaths are due to heart attacks and strokes, and one-third of these deaths occur prematurely in people under 70 years of age. Heart failure is a common event caused by CVDs and this dataset contains 11 features that can be used to predict a possible heart disease.

People with cardiovascular disease or who are at high cardiovascular risk (due to the presence of one or more risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidaemia or already established disease) need early detection and management wherein a machine learning model can be of great help.

## About the project

This project aims to predict cardiovascular diseases based on a set of key patient attributes. The considered attributes include:

Age: age of the patient [years]

Sex: sex of the patient [M: Male, F: Female]

ChestPainType: chest pain type [TA: Typical Angina, ATA: Atypical Angina, NAP: Non-Anginal Pain, ASY: Asymptomatic]

RestingBP: resting blood pressure [mm Hg]

Cholesterol: serum cholesterol [mm/dl]

FastingBS: fasting blood sugar [1: if FastingBS > 120 mg/dl, 0: otherwise]

RestingECG: resting electrocardiogram results [Normal: Normal, ST: having ST-T wave abnormality (T wave inversions and/or ST elevation or depression of > 0.05 mV), LVH: showing probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy by Estes' criteria]

MaxHR: maximum heart rate achieved [Numeric value between 60 and 202]

ExerciseAngina: exercise-induced angina [Y: Yes, N: No]

Oldpeak: oldpeak = ST [Numeric value measured in depression]

ST_Slope: the slope of the peak exercise ST segment [Up: upsloping, Flat: flat, Down: downsloping]

HeartDisease: output class [1: heart disease, 0: Normal]

### Our approach to achieving this goal involves several crucial steps:

Exploratory Data Analysis: Initially, we conduct a detailed analysis of the available data to better understand its characteristics, identify relevant trends and patterns, and detect potential discrepancies.

Data Preprocessing: Data often requires preprocessing to handle missing values, outliers, and improper formatting. In this step, we ensure that the data is ready for use with machine learning algorithms.

Machine Learning: We employ machine learning techniques to develop a predictive model capable of forecasting cardiovascular diseases based on the mentioned features. This includes the proper selection of algorithms, model training, validation, and fine-tuning.

The ultimate outcome of this project is a cardiovascular disease prediction system that can be used to assess a patient's risk of developing heart-related issues based on their personal and medical information.
